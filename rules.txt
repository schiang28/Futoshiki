2. The objective of the user is to fill in the grid such that each row and column only contains one digit of 1 to n (like a Latin Square).

3. Some digits may be given at the start.

4. Inequality constraints are specified between some adjacent cells. This indicates if a number has to be higher or lower than its neighbour.
